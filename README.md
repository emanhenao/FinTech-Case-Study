## FinTech Company/Domain Case Study
### Overview/Origin: Explore a trending FinTech company and domain to analyze how the company is responding to the problems and needs of the domain it is in, and how it is utilizing FinTech to solve current financial problems.
**Company: YCharts**
+ YCharts was incorporated in Chicago, IL in 2009 
+ Founders: Ara Anjargolian & Shawn Carpenter 
+	The idea for the company came about creating a real-time equity data platform that could be utilized within their domain. The founders aspired to create a platform also known as “The Financial Terminal of the Web”. The founders also wanted to create an investment research platform that provides 90% of the functionality of the other financial data terminals (Bloomberg, Yahoo! Finance, Reuters, etc.) at just 10% of the price. Additionally, the idea came about through co-founder, Shawn Carpenter having spent several years at Google prior to launching YCharts in 2009. He states, “It was at Google where I began to see the potential of data visualization technology and analysis”. YCharts brings the sophistication of the huge financial terminals but with more simplicity and ease. 
+	The company’s financing status is Venture Capital-Backed. YCharts is funded through a series of nearly 55 angel investors and venture capitalists.  The amount of funding they have received thus far is approximately $15 million dollars. 

**Business Activities** 
+ The specific financial problem YCharts is trying to solve is the demand to access a financial terminal with big data and key financial information that nearly every company requires. YCharts is enabling smarter investment decisions through their research platform by delivering a high-quality service, their financial terminal, that can allow wealth advisors and asset managers to connect on a more meaningful level with their clients in order to achieve a more sound and savvy investing experience. 
+ The company’s intended customer would be anyone that is seeking financial information who ultimately will use for creating greater portfolios/live data information for clients and greater investment decisions for investors. YCharts reports to have surpassed over 3,000-customer threshold, and over 700,000 users on their actual platform which means their market size is relatively large. As featured on Forbes, MarketWatch, and Investment News, YCharts has become one of the biggest research platforms in finance/wealth advising. YCharts also offers a stock screener that is unmatched and among the best in all the financial research tools. Their unfair advantage is their use of specific technologies and strategies to create much clearer communication with clients/customers, save time and resources and create a platform that is more practical and simpler to use than their competitors. 
+ Some of the technologies YCharts is currently using includes Python, Amazon RDS, Amazon CloudFront, Chartbeat, Google Analytics, My SQL, G Suite, Visual Studio, and Django. YCharts is presented on Amazon Web Services. The back end is written through Python while using a Django codebase. Their front end is written through JavaScript with a framework known as Highcharts that power all the visual tools.  

**Landscape** 
+ YCharts’ domain in the financial industry includes a combination of wealth management and enterprise solutions. YCharts’ primary clients include wealth advisors and asset managers along with being in the financial software business. 
+	The major trends and innovations of the wealth management and enterprise solutions domains over the last 5-10 years is extensive. In enterprise solutions, cloud-based enterprise software, smart enterprise applications, as well as a stable growth trend in AI and machine learning have been implemented over the past few years as this domain continues to grow quickly as time progresses. Wealth management has been updated as an overall platform/domain through Robo advisors who drive automated trading, investment advice overview, and portfolio rebalancing. 
+	Other major companies in this domain include Bloomberg, Sentieo, FactSet Research Management, Eikon, S&P Capital IQ Platform, Pitchbook, and AlphaSense.

**Results** 
+	YCharts has impacted the business they are in by allowing investors, clients, and managers to view the most up-to-date information which will ultimately allow them to use visual analysis’ to make smarter investment decisions and demonstrate the value behind their portfolio methods. During these unprecedented times, YCharts has implemented additional technologies to their clients in terms of communication to allow for greater forming of relationships and to utilize the resources provided to the best of their ability. YCharts has compiled articles and visuals that consist of the current impacts of the global coronavirus crisis, the oil price war, and measures being taken by the government of the United States. 
+	The core metrics that companies use in this domain to measure success and track performance are the services they offer, including the capacity of information and data the client can access at their preference. YCharts offers some of the most advanced and greatest research tools on the market for a more reasonable price than other FinTech research platforms. YCharts has received numerous amounts of accolades for their performance and services to their clients which includes “Top Investment Data/Analytics Tools People Are Thinking About Adding”. YCharts has gained a tremendous amount of attention which places them alongside Bloomberg, Google Finance, Yahoo Finance, Thomas Reuters, Sentieo, & FactSet Research Management as one of the greatest platforms in the world. 
+	YCharts is performing relatively well compared to its competitors in this domain. As time progresses, the need for information and data only grows stronger. YCharts recently was added to LPL Financials’ Vendor Program. The YCharts platform is now available to nearly 17,000 affiliated financial advisors through the Vendor Affinity Program. Due to investors wanting more personalized communication from their financial advisors, this business move is a big one for YCharts!

**Recommendations**
+	If I were to advise YCharts on what products or services to offer it would most likely be financial terminals like the Bloomberg terminals. Financial terminals nowadays are being used and implemented in nearly every major financial workplace and I personally think this would be a major step in improvement towards becoming an even greater major player as a FinTech platform. 
+	The financial terminals would benefit YCharts because I believe there would be a much higher demand for the platform to be used considering its cost effectiveness, its strength in services and offerings, and the audience it is expanding towards. 
+	The additional technology(s) the terminal would be using is Microsoft Windows/Citrix Receiver software to operate the terminal from a physical workspace.
+	The physical terminal is necessary because all workplaces would be able to utilize the services on a higher and more personal scale as oppose to just accessing from a remote location.
